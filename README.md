This assignment was done as a part of the Data Mining course work in BITS. The objective was to create and apply GSP (Generalised Sequential Pattern) algorithm from scratch to search for sequential patterns in an online retail dataset. The dataset has been selected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results have been compiled in the report attached above.
